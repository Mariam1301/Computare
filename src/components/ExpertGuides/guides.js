			'From 1st January of 2019, obligatory pension funds are present in Georgia.',
			`This means that every employee should transfer 2% of their income to the pension fund.On the other hand, employers should add another 2% and finally the government adds another 2%. As a result, 6% of gross income is accumulated every month in the employed persons pension fund. Those funds can only be obtained when a person reaches relevant age. Administration of deducting and transferring pension contributions is the duty of the employer. Letâ€™s take a look at an example: Kate works at a company as a receptionist, and she is 25 years old, her monthly salary is a gross 1000 Gel. Before the activation of the pension fund scheme Kate was paid a net 800 Gel. Which is 1000 gross salary minus 20% of income tax, which is paid by the company. After the activation of Pension fund scheme following scenario takes place: Company deducts 20Gel, which is 2% of 1000 Gel from Payment to Kate and transfers this amount to her pension fund, additionally Company transfers another 20Gel in Kate's pensions fund from companies own expenses. Also, Company now pays 1000*20%*98% = 196 Gel to the government as income tax, as pension contributions are exempt from income tax. To sum up, as a result of the activation of obligatory pension fund scheme in Georgia: Kate receives net salary from the company 796 Gel Income tax is paid to government by the company 196 Gel Amount Paid to Pension Fund by the company is 40Gel.`,
